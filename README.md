# fastHTML-easy_sample

This repository contains a simple web application built using the FastHTML library, a modern web framework designed to create scalable, interactive web apps in pure Python. This project demonstrates how to serve dynamic content, integrate custom CSS, and add interactivity using HTMX.

## Features

- **Dynamic HTML generation** with FastHTML.
- **CSS Styling** for enhanced UI.
- **Interactivity** with HTMX and Python-generated buttons.
- **Simple, fast setup** that leverages core web technologies like HTML, HTTP, and ASGI.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you'll need Python (3.7+). Additionally, ensure the `fasthtml` library is installed.

## Installation

Install FastHTML using pip:

```bash
pip install python-fasthtml
```

## Usage

1. **Create the Application:**

   Save the `main.py` code in a file.

2. **Run the Application:**
